% This is the demo code for a multiple kernel learning model with the 

% elastic net type regularization on the kernel weights.



% We have implemented four solvers: CVX, Yalmip, 'Mosek', 'Mosek_Conic'

% You need to add the path or set up correctly for different solvers

% If you have installed mosek, we suggest you use 'Mosek_Conic', which

% solves the Quadratically constrained by conic optimization



% You can run the demo in matlab by typing

%   demo_MKL_L12



% You are feel free to contact hqyang@cse.cuhk.edu.hk for the work.
